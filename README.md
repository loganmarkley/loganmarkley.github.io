# My Personal Website!
 
This is my very first side project that I started on October 6th of 2022!
At the time, I was a sophomore at the Missouri University of Science and Technology.

I started researching HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and realized that many coders make their own portfolio website to not only display passion and ability but creativity as well!
After that, I decided that I could make my own website and that it would be an incredible learning experience.
