My Personal Website!
 
This is my very first website that I started on 10-6-2022!
I made this from scratch using the fundamental aspects of HTML and CSS.
At the time, I was a sophomore at Missouri University of Science and Technology.
I started learning HTML and CSS and wanted to make my own personal website, and here we are!
