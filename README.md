My Personal Website!
 
This is my very first HTML project that I started on 10-6-2022!
I made this from scratch using the fundamental aspects of HTML and CSS.
At the time, I was a sophomore at Missouri University of Science and Technology.

I started researching HTML and CSS and realized that many coders make their own portfolio website to not only display passion and ability but creativity as well!
Having my own website with my name and details about me on it is incredible but a little crazy to think about.
