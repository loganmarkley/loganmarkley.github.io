                Hello! My name is Logan Markley.<br>I am a Sophomore studying towards a Bachelor's in Computer Science.<br>
                I go to Missouri University of Science and Techonology, and I plan to graudate in May of 2025.
            </p>
            <p>
                I currently work on-campus as a Peer Learning Assistant for the S&T Learning Enhancement Across Disciplines (LEAD) program on campus.
                <br>I facilitate small-group tutoring sessions and collaborate with two other PLAâ€™s to assist students with coursework and topics in Engineering Physics I.
                <br>I focus on inspiring learning without giving out solutions and rather through asking questions and making sure that students truly understand the how and why.
            </p>
            <p>
                Also, I was on the Formula Electric SAE Student Design Team during the Fall 2022 semester!
                <br>This team consisted of around 40 students, and we had to build and create a fully functional electric race car to compete in the national Formula SAE racing competition.
                <br>I worked in the electrical sub-team which deals with communication between the facets of the car such as the dashboard and the motor via messages and networks.
                <br>
                <br>I am currently looking to join a new design team that will better fit my likings and skills.
                <br>

            <p>
                I love listening to music, playing basketball, watching shows and movies, and thrifting!
                <br>I grew up just outside of St. Louis, Missouri, and I have always enjoyed video games, puzzles, and challenging my mind.
                <br>In high school, my favorite class was a digital electronics course in which I eventually made a small version of Mjolnir!
                <br>It has a flashlight which used my own wiring. I fully designed the Mjolnir model in Autodesk Inventor to be able to 3-D print it.
                <br>It was a super fun project, and it really let my creativity and dedication shine.
