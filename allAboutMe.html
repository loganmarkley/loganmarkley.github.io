                    <strong>Hello! My name is Logan Markley.<br>I am a junior studying towards a Bachelor's in Computer Science.<br>
                    I attend the Missouri University of Science and Technology, and I plan to graduate in May of 2025.</strong>
                </p>

                <p>
                    I currently work as a Peer Learning Assistant for the S&T Learning Enhancement Across Disciplines (LEAD) program on campus.
                    <br>I facilitate small-group tutoring sessions and collaborate with two other PLAâ€™s to assist students with coursework and topics in Engineering Physics I.
                    <br>I focus on inspiring learning without giving out solutions and rather through asking questions and making sure that students truly understand the how and why.
                    <br>Around 35 students attend these sessions which occur twice a week, and I love helping my peers comprehend and apply what they learn in lecture!
                </p>
                <p>
                    I also work on-campus as a Student Ambassador for the S&T Computer Science Department.
                    <br>The main focus of the role revolves around giving prospective families an overview of the Computer Science program at Missouri S&T.
                    <br>I do this by having a sit-down discussion with them which allows for a comprehensive talk about courses, extracurriculars, and more.
                    <br>After the discussion, I take them on a guided tour of the CS building, noting important features such as the professors' offices and popular rooms.
                    <br>And, of course, many questions are asked along the way, and I do my best to answer them and expand upon them to make the families feel comfortable and welcome!
                </p>

                    In high school, my favorite class was a digital electronics course in which I eventually made a small version of Mjolnir!
                    <br>It has a flashlight which used wiring and electronics that I created. Also, I fully designed the model using Autodesk Inventor, and this allowed me to 3-D print it.
                    <br>It was a super fun project, and it really let my creativity, passion, and dedication shine.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I love listening to music, playing basketball, watching shows and movies, thrifting, and coding!
                    <br>I grew up just outside of St. Louis, Missouri, and I have always enjoyed video games, puzzles, and challenging my mind.
                    <br>Check out some of my projects in the "My Projects" section! It has video demos and which languages I used for each.
