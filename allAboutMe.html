                    <strong>Hello again! My name is Logan Markley.<br>I am a junior studying towards a Bachelor's in Computer Science.<br>
                    I attend the Missouri University of Science and Technology, and I plan to graduate in May of 2025.</strong>
                </p>

                <p>
                    I have been actively involved in my university outside of the standard coursework, and I have worked three different<br>
                    on-campus part-time positions, two of which I still actively participate in.<br>
                    <br>To see the positions I have worked, check out my resume on the 'Contact Info' section!

                    In high school, my favorite class was a digital electronics course in which I eventually made a small version of Mjolnir!
                    <br>It has a flashlight which used wiring and electronics that I created. Also, I fully designed the model using Autodesk Inventor, and this allowed me to 3-D print it.
                    <br>It was a super fun project, and it really let my creativity, passion, and dedication shine.
                </p>

                <br>
                <p>
                    I love listening to music, playing basketball, watching shows and movies, thrifting, and coding!
                    <br>I grew up just outside of St. Louis, Missouri, and I have always enjoyed video games, puzzles, and challenging my mind.
                    <br>Check out some of my projects in the "My Projects" section! It has video demos and which languages I used for each.
