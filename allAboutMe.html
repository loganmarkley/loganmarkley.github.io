                Hello! My name is Logan Markley.<br>I am a Sophomore studying towards a Bachelor's in Computer Science.<br>
                I go to Missouri University of Science and Techonology, and I plan to graudate in May of 2025.
            </p>
            <p>
                I currently work on-campus as a Peer Learning Assistant for the S&T LEAD program.
                <br>I facilitate small-group tutoring sessions and collaborate with two other PLAâ€™s to assist students with coursework and topics in Engineering Physics I.
                <br>I focus on inspiring learning without giving out solutions and rather through asking questions and making sure that students truly understand the how and why.
            </p>
            <p>
                Also, I am on the Formula Electric SAE Student Design Team!
                <br>This team consists of many majors, and we have to build and create a fully functional electric race car to compete in the national Formula SAE competition.
                <br>I work in the electrical sub-team and in the creation of state machines and other code.
            </p>
            <p>
                I love listening to music, playing basketball, watching shows and movies, and thrifting!
            </p>
